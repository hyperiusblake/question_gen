# question_gen

This "Question Generator" was inspired by my desire to bridge connetions and get to know people on a deeper level. 

At first, I wanted to experiment with some Math functions while learning JavaScript, and after many Google searches, I decided to try my hand at a question randomizer. 

This is very much a work in progress, but I hope one day to add enough features and challenging questions to push it to the world as a fun way to get to know someone.
Whether you just met, or have been friends for years, there's something for all types of relationships here.
The assumed audience is 18+.
